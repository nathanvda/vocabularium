# Vocabularium

Vocabularium is a very easy site, with it's only intention that a user can enter sets of words, with a translation.
The languages you define yourself.

For the moment it is the intention that each user maintains her own set of words.
I can foresee somehow that user could share word-sets.

This is a small project, with the only intention that my daughter can learn her latin more easily :)

There are two phases in using the website:

* you sign up
* you define a language to learn
* you add set of words, and the intention is you will do this multiple times, while progressing and learning
* you test yourself, with a few options
** choose a few set of words
** run a limited test (selects randomly 10,20, ... words from the test)
** test all words from the set (randomly)
** after the test is run, you will see the results, and you can retry the words you failed
